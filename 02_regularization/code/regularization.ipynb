    "## Context\n",
    "Welcome to this part of your fourth programming assignment.\n",
    "In this part you will learn how to use regularization in your deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Deep Learning models have so much flexibility and capacity that **overfitting can be a serious problem**, if the training dataset is not big enough. Sure your model might do well on the training set, but it **doesn't generalize to new examples** that it has never seen! Regularization helps to deal with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3.\n",
    "- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes for Your Submission\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the mentioned, our test scripts will fail and as a result you will receive **0 points** for the respective task.\n",

We want to generate a vector that has 1's and 0's, where about 80% of them are 1 and about 20% are 0. This python statement: `X = (X < keep_prob).astype(int)` is conceptually the same as this if-else statement (for the simple case of a one-dimensional array) :\n",

    "Note that the `X = (X < keep_prob).astype(int)` works with multi-dimensional arrays, and the resulting output preserves the dimensions of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that without using `.astype(int)`, the result is an array of booleans `True` and `False`, which Python automatically converts to 1 and 0 if we multiply it with numbers.  (However, it's better practice to convert data into the data type that we intend, so try using `.astype(int)`.)"

    "- You only use dropout during training. Don't use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) during test time.\n",
    "- Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.\n",
    "- During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep_prob to keep the same expected value for the activations. For example, if keep_prob is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep_prob is other values than 0.5."
